## New Themes

If you would like to create a new **Dark Castle** theme for a missing platform:

1. Create a new repository based on this [Template](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Template).
2. Build the new theme using the [Color Palette](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Theme#color-palette) listed on the [Main Repository](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Theme).
3. Use the provided code samples located in the [Samples](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Template/tree/main/samples) folder to develop and test the theme, then delete it when you're finished with it.
4. Finally, [Submit an Issue (Feature Request)](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Theme/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) with a link to your repository. Once the theme is accepted, we will move the repository under the **Dark Castle** main repository and give you rights to maintain it ðŸ˜€.
