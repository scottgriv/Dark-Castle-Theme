## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <scott.grivner@gmail.com>.

## New Themes

If you would like to create a new **Dark Castle** theme for a missing platform, please follow the steps below:

### Repository Setup

1. Create a new repository based on this [Template](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Template).
2. Name the repository `Dark-Castle-<PLATFORM>`, replacing `<PLATFORM>` with the name of the platform you're creating the theme for (e.g., `Dark-Castle-Example`).
3. Update the repository description (follow the template's description structure).
4. Add the website link to the repository description: [https://darkcastle.netlify.app/](https://darkcastle.netlify.app/).
5. Add relevant topics/tags (e.g., `dark-castle`, `theme`, `<PLATFORM>`) (follow the template's description structure) and add more relevant topics as needed).
6. Update the `README.md` to reflect the new theme and its maintainer. 
7. Add a `screenshot.png` image in the root of the repository, showcasing the theme in action on the target platform.
8. Create an `INSTALL.md` file with installation instructions specific to the platform.
9. Drop the theme files into the root of the repository (follow the [Building the Theme](#building-the-theme) section below for guidance).
10. Optionally, add a `CHANGELOG.md` file to `.github/` directory for future changes and updates to the theme.

> [!NOTE]
> If you used the template repository, most of these steps will already be done for you. You just need to update the relevant information to fit your new theme. 
> The purpose of the template is to remove the boilerplate work so you can focus on building the theme itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The above structure is important for consistency across all themes in the **Dark Castle** project. Please ensure to follow it closely.

### Building the Theme

1. Build the new theme using the [Color Palette](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Theme#color-palette) listed on the [Main Repository](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Theme).
2. Use the provided code samples located in the [Samples](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Template/tree/main/samples) folder to develop and test the theme, then delete it when you're finished with it.
3. Finally, [Submit an Issue (Feature Request)](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Theme/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) with a link to your repository. Once the theme is accepted, we will move the repository under the **Dark Castle** main repository and then give you rights to maintain it ðŸ˜€.
