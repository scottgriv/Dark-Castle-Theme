## Background Story

Back in 2013, I ([Scott Griv](https://github.com/scottgriv)) began to grow tired of the simple dark color themes provided out of the box with my [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) or [Text Editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) at the time. I decided to take a crack at building my own theme. The first platform I built it on was [Text Wrangler](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/), now migrated to [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html), and that original theme can be found [here](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-BBEdit).

I was inspired to make this theme by a number of things, including video games like [Dwarf Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress), [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft), and [Warcraft 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos). Books and movies such as [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings), [The Hobbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit), [Vikings](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings_(TV_series)>), and [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones), also influenced its design. Additionally, historical events and archaeological discoveries played a significant part in shaping the theme. In particular, the rich history and majestic architecture of Scottish castles like [Edinburgh Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle) fueled my imagination and contributed to the overall aesthetic of the theme.

Yeah... a lot of nerdy stuff. I know üòÜ

For over a decade, I hoarded this theme for myself, but now I've decided to give it to the world and open source it, which brings you here right now.

I started out with some of my most used platforms and hope to add more over time, and maybe get some help from the OSS community to help me port more over if others end up liking it as well. Enjoy! üòÄ

## Installation

1. Reference the [Themes](themes) folder for each platforms repository.
2. Follow the `INSTALL.md` file in the root of the repository for specific instructions for said platform.
3. Enjoy!

## FAQ

###### "Are you going to support editor X?"

Hopefully!, but we need your help to accomplish that. Since you're already using app X you're probably much more experienced in it than we are. So give it a try first!

###### "How do I submit a new theme?"

If you would like to contribute to an existing theme and/or port over **Dark Castle** to a missing platform:

1. Create a new repository based on this [Template](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Template).
2. Build the new theme using the [Color Palette](#color-palette) above.
3. Use the provided code samples located in the [Samples](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Template/tree/main/samples) folder to develop and test the theme, then delete it when you're finished with it.
4. Follow the [Contributing Guidelines](#contributing).
5. Finally, [Submit an Issue (Feature Request)](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-Theme/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) with a link to your repository. Once the theme is accepted, we will move the repository under the **Dark Castle** main repository and give you rights to maintain it üòÄ.

> [!NOTE]
> In the future, if the project grows, we may move the theme repos to its own organization and give contributors the rights to maintain their submissions (similar to Dracula's structure).

## Credits

- [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/): for providing their open-source theme, templates, install instructions, and overall theme structure. We owe a lot to the Dracula Team for making an awesome open-source theme that inspired us to make our own. Not to mention, they seemingly cracked the code on how to properly manage multiple platform themes, which is why our structure is similar to theirs (including the install instructions). We cannot thank the Dracula Team and their contributors enough for paving the road for our theme.
