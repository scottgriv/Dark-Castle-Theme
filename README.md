## Background Story

Back in 2013, I ([Scott Griv](https://github.com/scottgriv)) began to grow tired of the simple dark color themes provided out of the box with my [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) or [Text Editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) at the time. I decided to take a crack at building my own theme. The first platform I built it on was [Text Wrangler](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/), now migrated to [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html), and that original theme can be found [here](https://github.com/scottgriv/Dark-Castle-BBEdit).

I was inspired to make this theme by a number of things, including video games like [Dwarf Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress), [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft), and [Warcraft 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos). Books and movies such as [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings), [The Hobbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit), [Vikings](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings_(TV_series)>), and [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones), also influenced its design. Additionally, historical events and archaeological discoveries played a significant part in shaping the theme. In particular, the rich history and majestic architecture of Scottish castles like [Edinburgh Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle) fueled my imagination and contributed to the overall aesthetic of the theme.

Yeah... a lot of nerdy stuff. I know üòÜ

For over a decade, I hoarded this theme for myself, but now I've decided to give it to the world and open source it, which brings you here right now.

I started out with some of my most used platforms and hope to add more over time, and maybe get some help from the OSS community to help me create more, if others end up enjoying it as much as I have. Enjoy! üòÄ

## Installation

1. Reference the [Themes](themes) folder for each platforms repository (or by clicking the links above).
2. Follow the **Install** file (`INSTALL.md`) in the root of the repository for specific instructions for said platform.
3. Enjoy!

## Contributing

> "Are you going to support editor X?"

Hopefully! But, we'll need your help to accomplish that. Since you're already using app X, you're probably much more experienced in it than we are. So give it a try first!
